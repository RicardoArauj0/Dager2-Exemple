Dagger2 Example
=====================

Dagger 2 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection.
Taking the approach started in Dagger 1.x to its ultimate conclusion,
Dagger 2.x eliminates all reflection,
and improves code clarity by removing the traditional ObjectGraph/Injector in favor of
user-specified @Component interfaces.

This is just a sample Android project which demonstrates the way of integrating [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger) into your application.
